# ClockProject
Created Using Java

Alarm Clock Project created using Java. Utilized topics such as String parsing, type casting, regex, signal/slot (evt), I/O, 
and tons and tons of debugging.
This was a fun project to work on, until adding the "alarm sound" file into the project. 
(The consistent alarm loop and the numerous hours debugging was hectic!) I believe this project could be less sloppy, 
the code (especially near the final portions of the project) became more spread out with variables being created everywhere.
